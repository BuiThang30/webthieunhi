                In <a href="#">Part 1</a>, we have explored how the demand for a certain good is conceived, 
                and see how the quantity demanded of a good (in our case, breadsticks!) can be affected by changing prices. 
                Now, what if I say that even when the price of breadsticks doesn’t change, demand can still change. 
                This is equivalent to saying that “Well even though the breadsticks are just as cheap and good, 
                you may still want less of them.” So how does this happen? Economists offer us 5 main factors 
                affecting the demand for a good/service.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, let’s come back to our breadstick lady and look at you! A consumer in the market of breadsticks! 
                A loyal customer of your favorite bread lady!
            </p>

            <p>
                Have you ever woken up in the morning and felt like eating something else for breakfast? 
                Somehow on this kind of morning the breadsticks are so oily, salty and fatty because you have 
                been munching these sticks for several days in a row. Sick of the pate and the bread, you make your 
                way to the soy milk auntie next to your bread lady and just drink a cup of soy milk for the day 
                (Of course, you will feel so guilty as if you’re cheating on your favorite bread lady). 
                In this case, whatever the prices of the bread, 2,000VND, 10,000VND or 50,000VND, 
                you would still prefer a cup of soy milk and would buy less bread. 
                Economists say that “Your demand for breadsticks has decreased due to changing tastes and preferences”, 
                because at every price, you don’t prefer bread as much and would not buy as many breadsticks as you used to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, let’s imagine another situation: 
                You have been very distracting in class, your teacher has called your parents, and your mom decided to impose sanctions by cutting your breakfast allowance by 50%. 
                This is similar to having a cut in your income. 
                And this is kinda obvious, isn’t it? If you have less money to spend, of course you won’t buy as many breadsticks. 
                If not then how are you gonna settle for your lunch? In this case, economists say that “Your demand for breadsticks has decreased due to decreasing income”.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Oh wait! Your income drops, but there’s a pho stall just opened near your school and they are having a 50% grand opening discount. Great! This means you can enjoy a hearty bowl of pho in the morning, and still have some money to spare for lunch and dinner. How about the bread lady? Oops, probably she’d have to wait till your mom’s sanctions are lifted, or the pho stall ends their discount. In Economics, pho and breadsticks here are called substitutes because they cater for the same need: breakfast! And you have seen it, the price of pho - a substitute for breadsticks - can affect the demand for breadsticks themselves. Economists say that “Your demand for breadsticks has decreased due to changing prices of substitutes”
            </p>

            <p>
                Alright now that’s 3 factors. There’s one more, just as important: Your expectations of the prices of breadsticks. Remember that MASSIVE drop in prices of pork in Hanoi two years ago? Think about it, pate is mainly made of pork, so if pork price drops, breadstick sellers will likely lower their prices to attract customers while still retaining some profits. Knowing this, you decide to hold back your spending on breadsticks so enjoy the cheap prices in the future. In such cases, economists say that “Your demand for breadsticks has decreased because your expectations of future prices change”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cool! Now that we have looked at you as an individual breadstick consumer. Let us now scale up and consider thousands of such consumers around Hanoi. While most factors will have the same effects as above, there is one more very easy, yet so important, factor: The number of people who eat breadsticks for breakfast! Well, if there are more people who want breadsticks for breakfast, more breadsticks are sold regardless of the prices, and the demand for breadsticks will increase. Duh! Obvious right? Economists therefore say that “The demand for breadsticks increased due to increase in population (here the number of people who enjoy breadsticks for breakfast)”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh, and in case you wonder how we visually represent this increase/ decrease in demand of the whole market, we move the entire demand curve right and left, respectively. As you can see in the diagram below, when the demand curve is to the right, more breadsticks are demanded at every price, reflecting the nature of increasing demand as we discussed above. The same applies a leftward shift indicating a drop in demand.:
