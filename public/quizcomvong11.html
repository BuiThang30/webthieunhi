        Equilibrium
      </h2>
      <p>
        The equilibrium suggests that Ms.Phuong should set the Cốm price at 6$ per kilogram. However, a recent research in ingredients suppliers done by her consultants offers a new transporting method with a lower marginal cost, which could help her set the price at 5$ without having any losses in marginal revenues. What price should she choose? And why?

            <span class="option-label">A.</span>
            <span class="option-text">6$, because price is a signal of a market, and any sudden change could cause big losses to the entire market</span>

            <span class="option-text">6$, because that's the current equilbrium point of Cốm market, and following that price, as theoretically and practically proven, would maximize our business's revenues</span>

            <span class="option-label">C.</span>
            <span class="option-text">5$, we can reduce the marginal cost, so this reduction in price would not only keep our marginal revenue stable but also create a competitive advantage, which attracts more customers</span>

            <span class="option-label">D.</span>
            <span class="option-text">5$, to reduce losses for the market, she decided to spread this news out to rivalries so that they can also reduce their price, hence shifting up the supply of the whole market, lowering the equilibrium price to 5$</span>

          <h3><strong>Answer: Point C</strong></h3>
          <hr>
          <h4>Explanation:</h4>
          <p> 
            There would be an initial reduction in quantity supplied for Cốm if the price shifts down, but this change causes no damage to our business, since we can still remain our quantity supplied unchaged. This change may also eliminate some of our opponents. Failure in utilizing this advantage would reduce your revenues remarkably
          </p>

          <p>
            It's true just in case there is no change in supply or demand, while an innovation, as in this case, is an utterly change. This has not been updated by the current Cốm market model, so that equlibrium is no more appropriate 
          </p>

          <p>
            This change is a totally competitive advantage and brings you a lot of customers. After some time, your rivalries may also find a new way of reducing their cost and keep the competition more balance. However, this innovation increases your revenues drastically
          <p>
            It makes no sense to help our opponents. This may also brings some benefits, but not considerable, as this change will be no more a competitive advantage
