        Elasticity of demand
      </h2>
      <p>
        A recent economic recession has forced most companies in Vietnam to lower employees’ wages by 20%. This leads to a reduction in demand, which means for the same price of cốm as usual, less people could afford it. What should Mrs. Phuong do during this recession?

          <h3><strong>Answer: Point D</strong></h3>
          <hr>
          <h4>Explanation:</h4>
          <p> 
            Increase in price only results in a bigger plummet in the amount of customers
          </p>

          <p>
            Hiring more workers means Mrs. Phuong will have to increase the price to compensate the additional wages
          </p>

          <p>
            Less cốm can be produced in this case would not make it scarcer,  and, increase in price will only decreases the number of consumers
          </p>

          <p>
            Laying off workers can help her decrease the price of cốm, since less expense need to be spent on wages. This is the most optimal choice, and this timely measure would minimize the losses in revenue during the economic recession
