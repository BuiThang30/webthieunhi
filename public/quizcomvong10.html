        Elasticity of Supply

        The quantity supplied in cốm market increased steadily recently. What could be the causes?

          <h3><strong>Answer: Point A</strong></h3>
          <hr>
          <h4>Explanation:</h4>
          <p> 
            The increase transporting costs will lead to an increase in cốm's price. This will attract participants to enter the market, especially who have alternatives such as cars or mottorbikes - this could be competitive advantage for them. Hence, it would lead to a rise in supply.
          </p>

          <p>
            The net receiver of the tax is the government, neither the supplier nor the customer. Suppose the tax is 1$, the initial price is 10$. After the implementation of the tax, there are two possible scenarios. Firstly, suppliers decided to put all the tax on customers, so the price will go up to 11$; the receiver of the 1$ difference is the government, suppliers still receive the initial 10$, but customers lost 1$, so not only the supply remains unchanged, but also the demand decreases. The second scenario is suppliers put part of the tax on themselves, suppose 50%; then the price for customers is 10.5$, but for suppliers, it’s just 9.5$ - still a loss. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This will reduce the amount of customers and the demand in general - no incentive to increase the supply
          <p>
            This may increase the quantity demanded by a slight amount, but since the supply is inelastic, as we have discussed before, that change would not really affect the quantity supplied.
