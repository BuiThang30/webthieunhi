        Little John has always dreamt of opening his own pho store. After working hard for 10 years he saved up enough to buy a run-down pho store near his apartment. After renovating his new pho store with galvanized steel squares, screws borrowed from his aunt and veneer wood plates, he could finally open his business. But there is one problem: he doesnâ€™t know any pricing mechanism and has no economic knowledge whatsoever.
