        Free trade and trade protectionism
      </h2>
      <p>
        Little John sources some of his ingredients from international suppliers. Recently, the government introduced a subsidy for local rice producers to make their products cheaper compared to imported rice. This has led to a decrease in the cost of rice used in Little John’s pho.
      </p>
      <p>
      Which of the following best describes the impact of the government’s subsidy on Little John’s business and the broader trade policy?

          <hr>
          <h4>Explanation:</h4>
          <ul class="paragraph-list" style="list-style-type: disc;  font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">
            <li><p>Free Trade refers to the absence of trade barriers, which is not supported by the subsidy that aims to make local products cheaper and indirectly affects imported goods.</p></li>
            <li><p>Trade Protectionism involves measures like subsidies that protect local industries from foreign competition by making their products more competitive compared to imports. In this case, the subsidy for local rice producers is intended to reduce the cost of local rice, making it more competitive relative to imported rice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Comparative Advantage is about the ability to produce goods at a lower opportunity cost, which is not directly influenced by the subsidy but rather by overall cost efficiencies and productivity.</p></li>
            <li><p>Absolute Advantage refers to the ability to produce more of a good with the same resources, which is not directly related to the effect of a subsidy.</p></li>
